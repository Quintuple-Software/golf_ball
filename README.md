# Efficient Golf Ball Detection and Tracking Based on Convolutional Neural Networks and Kalman Filter 

We borrow the codes and implementations from [jwyang-faster-rcnn.pytorch](https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch/tree/pytorch-1.0), the Pytorch version is 1.0, pleaes refer to [jwyang-faster-rcnn.pytorch](https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch/tree/pytorch-1.0) for more details of setups and implementations.

Below are some detection results:
